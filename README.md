# Weather_app

weather app built with node js and express

## Landing page

This page was created mainly for future additions like user authentication

## Main weather search page

Weather data is gathered from open weather api

Image is from unsplash, if image for city cannot be found, default image will render

### City validation

This app checks if input city is valid city name ( f.e. does not contain numbers ) and checks if it exist in open weather database

#### This app was created to better understand how back-end and node js works, because it is often used with React
